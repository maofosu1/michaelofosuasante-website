                <li>Analyzed and modeled students' energy-saving behaviors using R and STATA.</li>
                <li>Developed a comprehensive model, contributing to more effective energy-saving programs and sustainability
                    initiatives within educational institutions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Measles Vaccination Coverage Cluster Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Performed hierarchical clustering analysis in R on district-level data including vaccination rates,
                    demographics, healthcare access, and utilization.</li>
                <li>Identified distinct clusters and profiles of districts with varying measles vaccination coverage. Provided
                    context and implications for the clustering patterns based on healthcare infrastructure and population
                    characteristics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Understanding Postpartum Exercise and Body Image Satisfaction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducted regression analysis and ANOVA tests in STATA to model associations between age, race, education
                    level, and postpartum exercise frequency/duration.</li>
                <li>Key findings showed postpartum exercise for 2+ hours per week was linked to higher body image satisfaction
                    across all demographics. This highlights the importance of physical guidance and community programs to
                    encourage postpartum physical activity.</li>

                <li>Performed correlation and regression analysis in R to assess relationships between bone calcium/phosphorus
                    levels, presumed dietary patterns, geographic location, and disease prevalence.</li>
                <li>Key findings revealed associations between high cereals diets in certain regions and elevated phosphorus
                    levels, indicating malnutrition and rickets prevalence</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Predictive Analysis for Forecasting Stock Returns</h3>
